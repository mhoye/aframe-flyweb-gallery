### Installation

To get started, you'll need node and npm installed locally, then clone this repository.

```bash
To get set up: npm install
To serve up the site locally: npm run serve
To serve up the site with discoverability: npm run gallery

You can observe it machine-locally via `http://localhost:9090` for testing.

For discoverability, you'll need to be running a browser that supports WebVR and FlyWeb,
preferably on a device with motion sensors.
